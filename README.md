# 60212
Includes work done for the class 60-212: Interactivity and Computation

Intersections (in both p5.js and Processing)- Generates random line segments of a constant length, and draws a circle at every point of intersection.

Clock (p5.js)- A digital clock with a rudimentary physics system. There are 132 "marbles", each with a number on it. The marbles grow and shrink based on what time it is, and the three largest marbles display the hours, minutes, and seconds.

Interruptions (p5.js) - A piece of generative art designed to mimic Vera Molnar's piece entitled "Interruptions." Short line segments are generated in a random but highly controlled way. In places, large clumps of lines are missing.

Animated Loop (p5.js)- A simple animation that shows line segments "climbing" down a ladder of horizontal line segments, forming stripes and squares as they go. It loops indefinetely.

Three_Trees_PDF (Processing) - Displays (and saves as a pdf) a random set of eight topographically unique binary trees, with some random wiggling for added character. Example pdf "pretty_nice_trees" is included in folder.

Three_Trees (Processing) - Displays a random set of eight topographically unique binary trees, with some random wiggling for added character. Also sends real time commands for Axidraw machine to paint these trees, including returning to the ink well (if Axidraw machine is hooked up). Video of this executing "Three_Trees.mp4" is included in folder and at this link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv8tembgAcA&feature=youtu.be). All pde files that are not Three_Trees.pde were not written by me, but I included them as they are required to connect the code to the Axidraw.
