Tracing Movement (Processing) - 12/9/16
Uses BVH motion capture data to generate real time commands for Axidraw machine (if one is hooked up) to paint an image of the motion, tracing the path of each hand/foot in a different color (I wrote the Motion_Tracer.pde file, and modified some of the others). 
Some example BVH files I used are included in the data folder, and photos of some of the paintings created by the Axidraw are in the Images folder. A documentation video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw7HS-e2mCk
