"Bike Data Visualization" analyzes data from Healthy Ride PGH about bike rentals in Pittsburgh. The data is in the form of .csv files in the 2016-Q3 folder, and copies of it are in each of the other folders as well. 

Export2darray.pde is a Processing file that generates a myMatrix.txt file (included) containining a matrix counting the number of rides from each stop to each other stop. 
Export2darraylimited.pde generates a similar myMatrix.txt file (included) containing a smaller matrix, that only maps the rides between the 10 busiest stops and a generic "other" representing all other stops. These matrices were then copied into index.html, which included a portion of script written in D3 (I adapted this from the D3 blocks site). 

index.html displays a chord diagram that illustrates all of the rides between stops.

"All Data Graph.png" is an image of the chord diagram generated by the complete data matrix. "Green Top 10 Graph.png" is an image of the chord diagram generated by the matrix of the ten busiest bike stops in Pittsburgh. "Colored Top 10 Graph.png" is a picture of the same diagram but with a different color scheme. index.html currently contains code that would generate a graph like "Colored Top 10 Graph.png".

In general, this was only an exercise in data visualization, and if I were to spend more time on it I would like to add more to index.html such as a key to the digram, or a little better context in the form of text.
